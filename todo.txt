x Get a plugin in sublime text
x determiine if a ln will work to the ~/code dir
x determine if it reloads automatically or if I have to restart
x is it python 2 or (3)?
	x 3
x where is the console?
	x ^`
x get an event listener that reacts to mouse movement
	x impossible
x This is harder than hoped :(
	x raw mouse events are not part of the API.
	x textcommands seem to be able to get event info, but mine isn't.
		x required having the trigger be a mouse event
x mousemap file calles text command
x text command moves mouse on click and release to nearest boundary
x give prefernce to ahead instead of behind
x it's bad UI anyway, but for some reason trying to move the point on_hover breaks things.
x not selecting a single character correctly.
	x solution was to not search if already at a boundary.
* get the keys working again.
* make which kind of boundary modifiable based on if you are holding the shift key.
* handle blank lines better, shouldn't snap to a different line?
* release 1.0


"One method of getting that information is to create an EventListener and listen for the drag_select command being executed, but there may be another way." -- it's possible that doesn't come through if ctrl-option is being held down, could try for modal.


Names

* A Fuzzy Mouse -- magentic mouse?
* Mouse Magnet
* Magnetic Mouse
* Magic Insert
* Fuzzy Insert


Plugin for sublime text that allows for mouse pointer insertion to magnet to the beginning/ending of words etc.

hold down a meta key while moving your mouse over text and the cursor will stick to the closest end of a word. if you click it's inserted there instead of under the mouse.

This should work with selection etc.

* hold down a key to make cursor placement more precise.
	* This seems doable
	* save the original insertion point
	* when you hold down the key combo, (or hit once to enter a selection mode?) move the cursor to the magnet near the curosr
	* clicking clears the mode and inserts it there
	* hitting esc puts it back where it was
		* or the key combo again if we are doing a mode?
		* or typing anythign?
	* I think that it's probably best as a hold it down, release to cancel, click to insert.
* This already works more or less with double clicking on a word to highlight it, puts you in a word-wise selection mode.
