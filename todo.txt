* get an event listener that reacts to mouse movement
* This is harder than hoped :(
	* raw mouse events are not part of the API.
	* textcommands seem to be able to get event info, but mine isn't.



A Fuzzy Mouse -- magentic mouse?


Plugin for sublime text that allows for mouse pointer insertion to magnet to the beginning/ending of words etc.

hold down a meta key while moving your mouse over text and the cursor will stick to the closest end of a word. if you click it's inserted there instead of under the mouse.

This should work with selection etc.

* hold down a key to make cursor placement more precise.
	* This seems doable
	* save the original insertion point
	* when you hold down the key combo, (or hit once to enter a selection mode?) move the cursor to the magnet near the curosr
	* clicking clears the mode and inserts it there
	* hitting esc puts it back where it was
		* or the key combo again if we are doing a mode?
		* or typing anythign?
	* I think that it's probably best as a hold it down, release to cancel, click to insert.
* This already works more or less with double clicking on a word to highlight it, puts you in a word-wise selection mode.
